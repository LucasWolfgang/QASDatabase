# QASDatabase
This is a library of files that the QAS Editor supports. The idea is to provide a database of questions that teachers and professors can use, not only with QAS Editor, but with any editor that accepts these formats
Most of the questions here were only translated by me to different formats. The first one weren't even created by me, since I used them during the development to verify that the parser was working correctly (to be more clear, I used the format. The content of the questions themselves were not used). If you have some questions here that you want me to remove for some reason, please open an issue and explain why.
The formats are:
 - Aiken file
 - Cloze file
 - GIFT file
 - Markdown files 
 - Moodle XML file
 - JSON (default format for the QAS Editor)

The current database is a mess, I know. When I have sometime I will organize it.
If you have well structures questions in one of the formats above that is not yet vailable in any public database, and you want (and can) do this, here could be a good place :smile:.
